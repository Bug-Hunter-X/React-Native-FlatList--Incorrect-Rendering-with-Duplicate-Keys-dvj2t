# React Native FlatList Bug: Duplicate Keys

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native's FlatList component related to duplicate keys.  When the `keyExtractor` function provides non-unique keys, FlatList behaves unexpectedly, resulting in incorrect rendering and performance problems. 

The `bug.js` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation.
